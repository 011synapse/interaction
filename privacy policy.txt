We understand that Interaction may be used to generate or interact with content that is sexually suggestive or intended for mature audiences. We take the following measures regarding NSFW content:

*   **User Responsibility:** You are solely responsible for ensuring that NSFW content generated or shared through Interaction on your Discord server(s) is appropriately labeled and restricted to users who are of legal age and have consented to view it. You must comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding the creation, distribution, and consumption of NSFW content.
*   **Age Verification:**  Interaction is intended for use by individuals who are of the age of majority in their jurisdiction. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 18. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child, we will take steps to delete it as soon as possible. **It is your responsibility as the server administrator to ensure that your server and the use of Interaction within it comply with age restrictions and child protection laws.**  We highly recommend you have clear rules and verification systems in place on your server to prevent access by minors to NSFW content.
*   **Content Moderation:** While we do not actively monitor message content, we reserve the right to take action, including suspending or terminating access to the bot, if we become aware of violations of our Terms of Service or illegal activities, including the distribution of child sexual abuse material.

However, no data transmission over the internet or electronic storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
